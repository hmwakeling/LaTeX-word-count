# LaTeX Word Count

LaTeX Word Count is a quick bash wordcount that uses texcount to count all .tex files in a given directory. The word count is then stored alongside the time the program was run and the data points are available to plot.

## Requirements


## Installation
Clone this 

## Usage
`./wordcount.sh` counts all words in all .tex files under current directory. The values are then stored an plotted. Basic implementation has been included to prevent too many data points per day.
