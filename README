# LaTeX Word Count

LaTeX Word Count is a quick bash wordcount that uses texcount to count all .tex files in a given directory. The word count is then stored alongside the time the program is run and available to plot.

## Installation

## Usage
`./wordcount.sh` counts all words in all .tex files under current directory. The values are then stored an plotted. Basic implementation has been included to prevent too many data points per day.

Fun usage: add ./wordcount.sh to your git hook pre-commit file to keep a detailed progression of your project (i.e. thesis!)
